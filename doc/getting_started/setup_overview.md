# Setup Overview

Here is a high-level overview of the installation and setup steps that will take you from complete scratch to running experiments and collecting data with eeg-notebooks.

## 1. Install Miniconda & set up your virtual environment
Miniconda makes it easy to manage multiple different Python installations on the same machine. While using miniconda environments is not required, we strongly recommend it. 
Follow installation instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## 2. Clone EEG-Notebooks and install dependencies
Follow the easy installation instructions found in the EEG-Notebooks documentation.

## 3. Setup your EEG device

Instructions will vary depending on what device you are using. A list of supported devices, and instructions for each can be found here [DEVICES LINK].

## 4. Run EEG experiments & collect data
EEG-Notebooks contains a script file called `run_notebooks.py` which provides prompts to guide you through running each type of experiment.
