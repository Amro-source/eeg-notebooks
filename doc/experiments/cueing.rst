Visual Cueing 
=========================================================

When our attention is cued to one side of visual space, we are faster and more accurate responding to things that happen there compared to things that happen in places that were not cued. 

In this notebook example we use a visual cueing task to manipulate attention. This task can ellicit a number of reliable changes in the brain and in behaviour. 

A central cue indicates the location of an upcoming target onset. Here the task can be changed to be perfectly predictive, or have some level of cue validity. The task is to indicate the orientation of a spatial grating on the target, up for vertical, right for horizontal.

The examples below demonstrate the following neural and cognitive empirical phenomena, elicited by the visual cueing task:

*ERPs* - Validly cued targets ellict larger ERPs than invalidly cued targets

*Behaviour* - Validly cued targets are more quickly identified and more accurately identified

*Oscillations* - Alpha power lateralizes after a spatial cue onset preceeding the upcoming onset of a target. Alpha power becomes smaller contraleral to the target side, and larger ipsilateral with the target.
